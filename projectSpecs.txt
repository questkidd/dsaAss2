Assignment #2
Students have learned different sorting algorithms during lectures. 
The assignment is to create a small console based application which 
can sort different types of data as per user's choice. The details are as follows:

Create a console based program through which a user can chose which type of data he want to sort. 
The data type choices will be: long, float, strings.
User will then select the algorthim he want to use for sorting. The choices are: 
Quick sort, merge sort, radix sort, and selection sort
The user will also select whether he/she want to sort in ascending order or descending order
The user will then given the input. Maximum size of the input is 100 items.
After input has been given, the following should be shown in the output on the screen: 
the array input, sorted array (asc or desc), and time complexity.
User must be able to choice multiple sorting algorithms at a time. 
In this case, the time complexity of each selected algorithm will be shown.
Submission: Create a single Word/PDF file with the following:
Download the assignment template file shared with assignment #1 on LMS. Use it for submission.
You have to include the screenshots of the output followed by all source code in the file.
Include the exe file which can be executed on a windows machine. 
Please note that the exe file must be executed without any error or it will result into dedution of marks.
It is a group task. All group member must participate equally in the assignment.
